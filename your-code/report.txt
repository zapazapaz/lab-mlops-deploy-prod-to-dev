For this lab I implemented a Python program to generate odd-order magic squares using NumPy. The project was set up with a virtual environment, and dependencies were documented in requirements.txt. Using Git for version control, excluding the virtual environment folder from the repository. The code was pushed to GitHub, reviewed and merged after its verification.

After merging, the Gatekeeper pulled the latest changes, set up the environment, and ran the project to ensure it executed without errors. The team then swapped roles and repeated the process. Challenges included initial dependency conflicts and mistakenly committing the virtual environment folder, which were resolved by specifying a compatible NumPy version and updating .gitignore. This exercise effectively reinforced version control practices, environment management, and team collaboration, providing hands-on experience in deploying Python code in an MLOps workflow.
