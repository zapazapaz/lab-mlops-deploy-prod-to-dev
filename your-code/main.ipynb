    "## Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will work in pairs to simulate the process of deploying code from a development environment (DEV) to a production environment (PRD). One student will act as the developer pushing code, while the other will be the gatekeeper ensuring the code runs correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Form Pairs\n",
    "- Split into pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Developer Role\n",
    "1. **Push Code to Repository**\n",
    "   - Create a new project or use an existing one\n",
    "   - Copy the code to a folder (which will be a git repo in a few minutes)\n",
    "   - Create a venv (see previous class in case you missed something)\n",
    "   - Install all the necessary packages\n",
    "   - Create the requirements.txt file\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Initialize a git repository in your project folder:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     git init\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add your project files to the repository - **do not add the venv folder to git**:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     git add [each_file]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Commit your changes:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Push your project to a remote git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>\n",
    "     git push -u origin main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Pull Request**\n",
    "   - Go to your remote repository and create a pull request (PR).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Gatekeeper Role\n",
    "1. **Review and Pull Code**\n",
    "   - Review the pull request created by your partner.\n",
    "   - If everything looks good, merge the pull request.\n",
    "   - Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     git pull origin main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setup Environment**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the project directory.\n",
    "   - Create an empty venv\n",
    "   - Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Project**\n",
    "   - Ensure the project runs without errors.\n",
    "   - Provide feedback to the developer if there are any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Swap Roles and Repeat\n",
    "- Swap roles and repeat the exercise, so each student gets to be both the developer and the gatekeeper.\n",
    "  - Bonus: to simulate reality, try to do this again outside a video call (via Slack messages for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Ensure clear communication between partners during the process.\n",
    "- Make use of version control best practices.\n",
    "- Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- Each pair should have a functioning project that has been successfully reviewed, pulled, and run by the gatekeeper.\n",
    "- A brief report on the process, any challenges faced, and how they were overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck and happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
